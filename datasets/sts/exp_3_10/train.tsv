negative	supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment
negative	despite auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug

negative	director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself
negative	lrb soderbergh rrb tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness

positive	when all is said and done , she loves them to pieces and so , i trust , will you
positive	indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock you into laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions
positive	the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema
positive	it 's fun , but it 's a real howler
